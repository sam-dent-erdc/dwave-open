This repository contains open-source projects that utilize D-Wave's quantum processing unit (QPU) and/or quantum hybrid solvers. 
Projects are organized by folder. 

To run these Jupyter notebooks, you will need access to D-Wave's solvers. 
An easy option is to create an account for Leap, D-Wave's quantum cloud service which supplies an API token (https://cloud.dwavesys.com/leap). 
D-Wave offers several account options including a free trial.
